        I started taking classes at KSU in 2021. I am currently majoring in Information Technology, and my goal is to use this learning to elevate my chances at a career in Database Security and/or Administation.
        Overall, I have had a very good time with my classes and only had wonderful professors here at KSU, and I look forward to learning the skills that will assist me in a future career. Before this class, 
        I had no experience with HTML or CSS. I have mainly learned about Java and C#, and created a couple of cool projects with each. By the end of this class, I hope that I can create clean and comprehensive websites
        with ease.

        I am from Woodstock, Georgia and have not had a permanent residence outside of the state before. This, and the other classes that I have taken in the Computer Science field are so interesting to me, 
        because I have always had a love for technology. Understanding the inner workings of how hardware works was where this began, and I would rip apart any electronics I could get my hands on just to put 
        them back together. It's safe to say that this was not something that my parents were very fond of! As I grew older, and I was able to use more advanced technology, I began to wonder how the programs 
        and software worked too. Since then, I have always tried to work to better understand these things, but somehow the more I learn the less I feel like I know.

        Outside of school and my technology interests, I have always loved gaming. When I was little my dad would sit beside me and play video games with me after school. Most notably we would play the old Tomb Raider 
        and Megaman games taking turns on each death. I never grew out of this, and still play games with my friends as a way to bond and have fun! On the other hand, I love sports as well. I played Football all 
        through High School as the defensive left guard. This helped me to always prioritize my health and exercise, and I still love being active as a way to relieve stress and stay in shape today. Cooking is 
        also a passion of mine. It's therapeutic for me, and of course I always love when I am done and get to enjoy the result of my efforts.
