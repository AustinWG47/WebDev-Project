<h1>Welcome To My Journey</h1>
<!-- Paragraph text -->
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">My name is Austin Gammill, and this is the home page of my website for my Milestone#1 Project. On this website you can find out more about me, my time at KSU and even my contact information
    if you have any questions!

    This website was created in early October to demonstrate my ability to create a clean and coherent webpage with HTML and CSS. The main purpose of the website is to demonstrate that I am capable of setting up a webpage with functional structure, styling, and Client Side Scripting.
    To meet these requirements, I have created this website with 3 seperate pages, simple and appealing style, as well as form validation! I hope that this serves well as an introduction to me and the website. Please 
    vsiit the about page and the contact page to view additional information!
