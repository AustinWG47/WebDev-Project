<h1>Welcome To My Website</h1>
<!-- Paragraph text -->
<p style="text-indent: 0px;">My name is Austin Gammill, and this is the home page of my website for my Milestone#1 Project. On this website you can find out more about me, my time at KSU and even my contact information
    if you have any questions! 
</p>
<p>
    This website was created in early October to demonstrate my ability to create a clean and coherent webpage with HTML and CSS. The main purpose of the website is to demonstrate that I am capable of setting up a webpage with functional structure, styling, and Client Side Scripting.
    To meet these requirements, I have created this website with 3 seperate pages, simple and appealing style, as well as form validation! I hope that this serves well as an introduction to me and the website. Please 
    vsiit the about page and the contact page to view additional information!
